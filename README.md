# IMAGE_CAPTION_AUTOMATION
### Automatic-Image-Captioning A computer program that takes an image as input and produces a relevant caption as output.  Few applications where a solution to this problem can be very useful:  
**1.Self driving carsâ€” Automatic driving is one of the biggest challenges and if we can properly caption the scene around the car, it can give a boost to the self driving system.  
**2.CCTV cameras are everywhere today, but along with viewing the world, if we can also generate relevant captions, then we can raise alarms as soon as there is some malicious activity going on somewhere. This could probably help reduce some crime and/or accidents.

Given an image like the example below, our goal is to generate a caption such as "a surfer riding on a wave".
